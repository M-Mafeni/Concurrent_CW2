1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : [57] hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work
and what isn't:

[font bitmap was gotten from https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8/blob/master/font8x8_basic.h
drawChar algorithm was based on the one found here: https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Fonts ]

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious aspect (e.g., functional correctness); other aspects
outside this list can warrant an increase/decrease in marks, with examples
including hard to quantify features such as style, efficiency, robustness,
generality, or realism of a solution.  Put another way, identifying then
reasoning about these latter aspects forms part of the assessment, so they
are not (necessarily) detailed explicitly.

    Stage 1 : a baseline kernel
[X]           - pre-emptive multi-tasking                            ( 30%)
[X]           - priority-based scheduler                             ( 10%)

    Stage 2 : closed generalisations and enhancements
[X]           - fork, exec and exit system calls                     ( 15%)
[X]           - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)                    ( 15%)

    Stage 3 : open   generalisations and enhancements                ( 30%)
[?]           - MMU-based protection and virtualisation
                *OR*
[X]           - LCD screen and PS/2 device drivers and GUI
                *OR*
[?]           - file system based on simplified, emulated disk
                *OR*
[?]           - kernel port to real, physical hardware

                                                                     ------
                                                                     (100%)

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

[For the priority-based scheduler, I used an ageing technique to avoid starvation. Processes not currently running have their priority values increased. This is very useful as it avoids the problem
of a high-priority task taking up too much time. However, there is the slight possibility of an overflow error as I am only adding to the priority.
I used semaphores to tackle the dining philosophers problem. This helps to achieve mutual exclusion as the semaphore values acts as a lock only allowing 1 philosopher at a time.
Starvation is also avoided as sem_post signals to the waiting philosophers that they have finished. However, there are a few caveats with this solution. Because I did not implement
shm_open or mmap, my solution explicitly has to declare the chopsticks as a region in global memory (there is no memory protection so all the processes can access the same area in memory)
I tackled implementing the GUI for stage 3. I parsed the bytes gotten from the interrupt signals in order to get the key presses as well at the x and y value offsets for the mouse.
